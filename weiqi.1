.SH DESCRIPTION
.B weiqi
is a simple 3D Go board to play go against GTP engines with a higly
customisable interface.

.SH OPTIONS
A
.I player
is one of
.IR human " or " \fR<\fPengine_name\fR>\fP " or " socket:\fR<\fPpath\fR>\fP
where
.I engine_name
is a GTP go engine defined in the configuration file and
.I socket path
is a path to a UNIX domain socket. See
.I CONFIG
for more information on how to declare an engine.
.I human
is a player whose moves are registered from the graphical interface.
.B weiqi
accepts any combination of those players, including human versus human, engine
versus engine, etc.

.TP
.BI "\-w\fR/\fP\-\-white " player
Assigns
.I player
as the white player.

.TP
.BI "\-b\fR/\fP\-\-black " player
Assigns
.I player
as the black player.

.TP
.BI "\-r\fR/\fP\-\-random " "player player"
Randomly assigns the two specified players to white and black.

.TP
.BI "\-s\fR/\fP\-\-size " board_size
Sets the board size, where
.I board_size
is an integer between 5 and 25 (note that the size accepted by different engines
can vary, but anything between 7 and 19 is usually fine).

.TP
.BI "\-h\fR/\fP\-\-handicap " handicap
Sets the number of handicap stones.

.TP
.BI "\-i\fR/\fP\-\-interface " pure\fR|\fPnice
Interface mode.
.I pure
is minimal, uses a solid shader, no lighting, no reflection.
.I nice
looks more realistic, uses a modern PBR (physic based rendering) shader,
supports lighting, roughness, metalness.

.TP
.BI "\-f\fR/\fP\-\-fov " fov
Sets the camera field of view in degrees. You can set 0 for an orthographic
projection.

.TP
.BI "\-\-texture " texture_name\fR|\fPnone
Texture to use for the board. By default, you have the choice between
.IR wood.png ", " wood2.png " and " wood3.png .
You can add more in
.IR $PREFIX/share/weiqi .
.I none
will use a plain color instead, see
.I --color

.TP
.BI "\-\-color " "r g b"
The color to use for the board if texture is set to none.
.I r g b
are floats between 0 and 1.

.TP
.BI "\-\-coordinates"
Display coordinates on the board using letters and numbers.

.TP
.BI "\-\-client " "\fR<\fPplayer\fR>\fP socket:\fR<\fPpath\fR>\fP"
Runs weiqi in client mode. weiqi will connect to the specified UNIX domain
socket and query the server (most likely an other instance of weiqi running in
server mode) for all game parameters through the GTP protocol. weiqi will then
essentially behave like a GTP engine with whatever player is specified as the
backend.

.SH CONFIG
.B weiqi
looks for a JSON configuration file
.I $HOME/.config/weiqi/config.json
and will assume defaults if none is found.

.SH USAGE
.TP
.B Starting a game
Start a game by invoking
.B weiqi
with the desired parameters such as the size of the board and the number of
handicap stones.

.TP
.B In game interface
Left click on the board to place a stone somewhere when it's your turn (a black
square indicates the position at which the stone will be added). Press P to
pass your turn. Press backspace to undo your move, if the GTP engine supports
it. You can hold right click and drag the mouse to rotate the board. Press HOME
to reset the orientation. Useful information such as the white stones captures
(W), the black stones captured (B), the last move and the game status are
displayed in the window's title bar.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Default mode on a 9x9 board:
.B weiqi -s 9

.TP
Gnugo vs Gnugo on a 19x19 board:
.B weiqi -b gnugo -w gnugo

.TP
Gnugo vs human, random assignation, 19x19 board:
.B weiqi -r gnugo human

.TP
Gnugo vs human on a 19x19 board with pure interface, no texture and grey board:
.B weiqi -b gnugo -w human -i pure --texture none --color 0.5 0.5 0.5

.TP
Start a server listening on a UNIX domain socket with a random color assignment:
.B weiqi -r human socket:/tmp/weiqiconn

.TP
Start a client connecting to the previous server and a human backend:
.B weiqi --client human /tmp/weiqiconn

.SH FILES
.TP
.I $HOME/.config/weiqi/config.json
The configuration file. See
.I CONFIG
for configuration details.
